---7. Use DENSE_RANK() to rank products by StockQuantity without gaps in the ranking.

SELECT *, DENSE_RANK()OVER(ORDER BY StockQuantity)
FROM Products

---8. Create a query using ROW_NUMBER() to identify the second highest salary in each department.

SELECT * FROM (
	SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary) SalaryRank
	FROM Employees
) AS A
WHERE SalaryRank = 2

---9. Write a query to calculate the running total of sales for each product in the Sales table.

SELECT *, 
	   SUM(SalesAmount) OVER(PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY SalesDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS TotalPerProduct
FROM Sales

---10. Use LEAD() to display the SalesAmount of the next row for each employeeâ€™s sale in the Sales table.

--DIFFICULT TASKS

---1. Write a query using RANK() to rank products by their sales (handling ties) but exclude the top 10% of products by sales.
